) -> Tensor:
    r"""
    Take the result of an arbitrary tensor calculation, give it the desired symbol, and permute its indices to the given index specification.
    #### Parameters:
    * `formula`: The tensor object to process. Should usually be a tensor formula involving multiple tensor objects.
    * `symbol` (optional): A string or a SymPy `Symbol` object designating the symbol to be used when displaying the tensor. The string can include any TeX symbols, e.g. `r"\hat{T}"` (note the `r` in front of the string, indicating that the `\` in the string is not an escape character). If omitted, the placeholder $\square$ (`r"\square"`) will be used.
    * `permute`: A list of one or more strings or SymPy `Symbol` objects indicating the new index specification to permute the result to. `Symbol` objects will be converted into TeX strings, e.g. Symbol("mu") will be converted to "\mu". Strings must be given in the same format as SymPy's `symbols()` function, that is, a space- or comma-separated list of one or more letters or TeX codes. For example, "mu nu" will be converted to two strings, "\mu" and "\nu". The list will splice in any symbols, even if two or more symbols are defined together. For example, if `a` is a SymPy `Symbol` and the input is [a, "b", "c d"], the output will be ["a", "b", "c", "d"]. A single string of space- or comma-separated symbols can also be entered instead of a list.
    #### Returns:
    The result of the tensor calculation as a `Tensor` object with the desired symbol and index permutation.

        * `indices` (optional): A tuple of integers specifying the index configuration of the representation. Each integer in the tuple can be either +1 for an upper index or -1 for a lower index. If not specified, the tensor's default index configuration will be used.
        * `coords` (optional): An OGRePy `Coordinates` object specifying the coordinate system of the representation. If not specified, the tensor's default coordinate system will be used.
        * `warn` (optional): Whether to display a warning if using the default coordinate system and/or index configuration. This warning is intended to ensure that the user always knows which representation the components are given in, even if it is not specified explicitly. The default value is `True`; specify `warn=False` to suppress the warning.

        The desired components as a TeX string.

        * `indices` (optional): A tuple of integers specifying the index configuration of the representation. Each integer in the tuple can be either +1 for an upper index or -1 for a lower index. If not specified, the tensor's default index configuration will be used.
        * `letters` (optional): A list of zero or more strings or SymPy `Symbol` objects indicating the index specification. `Symbol` objects will be converted into TeX strings, e.g. Symbol("mu") will be converted to "\mu".

    #### Parameters:
    * `items` (optional): Zero or more strings or SymPy `Symbol` objects. `Symbol` objects will be converted into TeX strings, e.g. Symbol("mu") will be converted to "\mu". Strings must be given in the same format as SymPy's `symbols()` function, that is, a space- or comma-separated list of one or more letters or TeX codes. For example, "mu nu" will be converted to two strings, "\mu" and "\nu". The list will splice in any symbols, even if two or more symbols are defined together. For example, if `a` is a SymPy `Symbol` and the input is [a, "b", "c d"], the output will be ["a", "b", "c", "d"].
