    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "OGRePy is a modern Python package for differential geometry and tensor calculus, designed to be both powerful and user-friendly. It can be used in a variety of contexts where tensor calculations are needed, in both mathematics and physics, but it is especially suitable for general relativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tensors are abstract objects, which can be represented as multi-dimensional arrays once a choice of index configuration and coordinate system is made. OGRePy stays true to this definition, but takes away the complexities that come with combining tensors in different representations. This is done using an object-oriented programming approach, taking advantage of principles such as encapsulation and class invariants to eliminate the possibility of user error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user initially defines each tensor in OGRePy using its explicit components in any single representation. Operations on this tensor are then done abstractly, without needing to specify which representation to use. Possible operations include addition of tensors, multiplication of tensor by scalar, trace, contraction, and partial and covariant derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "OGRePy will automatically choose which representation to use for each tensor based on how the tensors are combined. For example, if two tensors are added, then OGRePy will automatically use the same index configuration (upper and lower indices) for both. Similarly, if two tensors are contracted, then OGRePy will automatically ensure that the contracted indices are one upper (contravariant) and one lower (covariant). OGRePy will also automatically transform all tensors being operated on to the same coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transformations between representations are done behind the scenes; all the user has to do is specify which metric to use for raising and lowering indices, and how to transform between the coordinate systems being used. This information only needs to be given once and for all when first defining the tensors and coordinate systems, and will be used automatically from that point on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that there is no room for user error. The user cannot mistakenly perform \"illegal\" operations such as $2A^{\\mu\\nu}+B_ {\\mu\\lambda}C_ {\\lambda\\nu}$. Instead, the user simply inputs the names of the tensors, the order (but **not** the configuration) of indices for each, and the operations to perform - and the correct combination $2A^{\\mu\\nu}+B^{\\mu}{}_ {\\lambda}C^{\\lambda\\nu}$ will be automatically deduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "OGRePy is a Python port of the popular Mathematica package [OGRe](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRe), first released in February 2021, used by many general relativity researchers worldwide. The Python port uses the same robust and performance-oriented algorithms, and retains the package's core design principles. It was made to be as flexible and powerful as possible, while also being simple to learn and easy to use, and suitable for both experienced and novice researchers. OGRePy uses [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) to facilitate symbolic computations and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) as a notebook interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python port was specifically designed to mimic as much of the original Mathematica package's syntax as possible, while also greatly improving on that syntax in many ways due to the fact that Python, unlike Mathematica, is a truly object-oriented language. The documentation for both packages was also kept as similar in structure and scope as possible, with the same practical examples. This means that anyone who is familiar with the Mathematica version should easily be able to use the Python version, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define coordinate systems and the transformation rules between them. The Jacobians are automatically calculated. Tensor components are then transformed automatically between coordinates behind the scenes as needed.\n",
    "* Each tensor is associated with a specific metric. Tensor components are then transformed automatically between different index configurations, raising and lowering indices behind the scenes as needed.\n",
    "* Display any tensor in any index configuration and coordinate system, either in vector/matrix form or as a list of all unique non-zero elements. Metrics can also be displayed as a line element.\n",
    "* Automatically simplify tensor components, optionally with a user-defined simplification function.\n",
    "* Easily calculate arbitrary tensor formulas using any combination of addition, multiplication by scalar, trace, contraction, partial derivative, covariant derivative, and permutation of indices.\n",
    "* Built-in methods for calculating the Christoffel symbols (Levi-Civita connection), Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor and scalar, Einstein tensor, Kretschmann scalar, curve Lagrangian, and volume element from a metric.\n",
    "* Calculate the geodesic equations in terms of an affine curve parameter, in two different ways: from the Christoffel symbols or from the curve Lagrangian. For spacetime metrics, the geodesic equations can be calculated in terms of the time coordinate.\n",
    "* Easily keep track of all tensors created in a notebook session, including the relations between them - for example, see which metrics were created and which tensors are associated with each metric.\n",
    "* Export tensor components in TeX or Mathematica format.\n",
    "* Designed with speed and performance in mind, using optimized algorithms developed specifically for this package.\n",
    "* Clear and detailed documentation, with many examples, in [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRePy/blob/master/OGRePy/docs/OGRePy_Documentation.ipynb), [HTML](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRePy/blob/master/OGRePy/docs/OGRePy_Documentation.html), and [PDF](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRePy/blob/master/OGRePy/docs/OGRePy_Documentation.pdf) formats.\n",
    "* Open source. The code is extensively documented; please feel free to fork and modify it as you see fit.\n",
    "* Under continuous and active development. Bug reports and feature requests are welcome, and should be made via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRePy/issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The object-oriented design philosophy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object-oriented programming** refers to a paradigm where a program's code is organized around objects. An **object** belongs to a user-defined type, called a **class**. The class defines the **data** that the object stores, as well as **methods** or **member functions** that read or manipulate that data. One of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming is **encapsulation**, which means that the user may only access an object's data using the methods defined by the class, and is unable to access the object's data directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, encapsulation allows for the preservation of **class invariants**. An invariant is a condition of validity that can always be assumed to be satisfied by the data stored in each object. If the methods make sure to preserve the invariant whenever they store or manipulate the data, and the user is prevented from changing the data manually and thus potentially violating the invariant, then the implementation of the class can be greatly simplified, and performance can be improved, because the class will not need to verify that the data is valid every time it performs an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind OGRePy is to simplify the use of tensors by encoding all the information about a tensor in a single, self-contained object. As I mentioned above, a tensor is an abstract object. One can find components which represent this abstract entity in a particular coordinate system and index configuration, but the tensor is **not** its components. In OGRePy, a tensor object is initially defined (or **constructed**) by providing the components of the tensor in a particular representation - but once this is done, the user does not need to worry about coordinates or indices anymore, or even remember which coordinates and indices were initially used. The abstract tensor object will automatically transform the initial data to a different coordinate system or index configuration as needed, based on the context in which it was used.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a tensor object holds the components of the same tensor in many different representations, the most important class invariant is the assumption that the different components indeed represent the same tensor. This is achieved using encapsulation; the object's data can only be modified by private methods that preserve the invariant, and thus the user cannot accidentally cause a violation of the invariant by assigning components to one representation that are not related to the components of all other representations by the appropriate coordinate and/or index transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Mathematica is not an object-oriented language, the original OGRe package merely simulated classes and objects using associative arrays, resulting in a somewhat awkward syntax. Python, on the other hand, is an inherently object-oriented language, and the Python package takes full advantage of that. Tensors are objects, and the various tensor operations are done directly on these objects using methods and overloaded operators. Class invariants and encapsulation guarantee that the different representations of the tensor objects are always consistent, and the correct representation is chosen on demand for each calculation using intelligent algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing and loading the package\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install OGRePy from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/OGRePy/) using `pip`, simply run the following command in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install OGRePy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version of OGRePy officially supports only **Python v3.12 and above**. It may also work with older versions of Python 3, but this is not guaranteed, as development and testing was only done with the indicated Python version. If your global Python installation is an older version, and you cannot upgrade it, consider using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) or [pyenv-win](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win) to install multiple Python versions in parallel, or use a portable local installation to run OGRePy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing OGRePy using `pip` will also automatically install its dependent packages, [ipykernel](https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/) and [sympy](https://pypi.org/project/sympy/), if they are not already installed. The current version of OGRePy officially supports only **ipykernel v6.29 and above** and **sympy v1.13 and above**, so if you are still using older versions, you should upgrade these packages using the command `pip install --upgrade ipykernel sympy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing in a virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced users may wish to install OGRePy inside a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) in order to avoid potential dependency conflicts with other packages. To do this, first open the directory where you would like to store your new virtual environment in the terminal, and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `python -m venv .OGRePy-env --upgrade-deps` on Windows,\n",
    "* `python3 -m venv .OGRePy-env --upgrade-deps` on WSL/Linux/macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a virtual environment under the `.OGRePy-env` subdirectory. The `--upgrade-deps` flag automatically upgrades `pip` to the latest version. To activate the virtual environment, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `.OGRePy-env\\Scripts\\activate.bat` on Windows (Command Prompt),\n",
    "* `& .OGRePy-env\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1` on Windows (PowerShell),\n",
    "* `source .OGRePy-env/bin/activate` on WSL/Linux/macOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this worked correctly, you will see the text `(.OGRePy-env)` at the beginning of the terminal prompt. Now you can install OGRePy using `pip` as above. To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run the command `deactivate` in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "OGRePy is designed to run within a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook. It is also possible to run it from within a Python script, usually for automation purposes, but Jupyter is required for interactivity and for displaying tensors and their components as rendered TeX equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "OGRePy supports two Jupyter notebook interfaces:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): **This is the officially recommended way to use OGRePy, due to helpful features such as IntelliSense, tooltips, and type checking.** Download and install from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Run VS Code, then create a new file with the `.ipynb` extension and open it, or press F1 to open the Command Pallette and choose the option \"Create: New Jupyter Notebook\". This will prompt you to automatically install the required VS Code extensions and Python packages if they are not already installed.\n",
    "* [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/): Install with `pip install jupyterlab`. Run by executing `jupyter-lab` in the terminal, and then create a new notebook in the web browser. **Please note that JupyterLab is not officially supported, as development and testing was only done with VS Code, although I have verified that the package does work in JupyterLab.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are running OGRePy in a virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "* With Visual Studio Code, open the folder where you create the virtual environment, press F1 to open the Command Pallette, choose the option \"Python: Select Interpreter\", and select the `.OGRePy-env` environment. The interpreter can also be selected for individual Jupyter notebooks in VS Code using the \"Select Kernel\" button at the top right of the notebook.\n",
    "* With JupyterLab, first activate the virtual environment in the terminal as explained above, and then run `jupyter-lab` from the same terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing the package\n",

    "All of OGRePy's functions are now accessible via the `T` namespace. While it is not common practice in Python to import packages as single letters, OGRePy uses this convention because in the original [Mathematica version of OGRe](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRe), all module names started with a capital T (which stands for \"Tensor\"). However, you can change that to another namespace if you prefer, for example `import OGRePy as gr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If desired, the welcome message can be disabled by defining `OGREPY_DISABLE_WELCOME = True` in the notebook before importing the package. Alternatively, you could set the environment variable `OGREPY_DISABLE_WELCOME` to `True`, which allows you to disable it permanently. If you changed your mind later and you want to see the welcome message (for example, if you want a link to the documentation), execute the command `T.welcome()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "OGRePy also automatically checks for updates from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/OGRePy/) when it is imported. This can be disabled by defining `OGREPY_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK = True` in the notebook, or setting the environment variable `OGREPY_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK` to `True`, before importing the package. In that case, you can still check for updates manually if you wish, using `T.update_check()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, note that this check is performed asynchronously, so it does not increase the load time of the package, and you can continue working while the check is being performed. If the welcome message is disabled, the startup update check is performed in \"quiet mode\", meaning that it only notifies you if a new version is available, but not if you are running the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting help\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons I recommend Visual Studio Code as the preferred notebook interface for this package is the IntelliSense feature, which displays a helpful popup with suggestions and information about various language components. To test this feature, once OGRePy is loaded in the notebook, create a new code cell and start typing `T.` - once you write the dot character, you will see a popup menu listing all the functions contained in the `T` namespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browse the menu using the arrow keys. There will be an additional popup next to this menu with the documentation for each function. If you do not see the documentation, press Ctrl+Space. You can also start typing to filter the options in the menu. For example, if you type `w`, the `welcome()` function will be selected, and you will see the documentation for that function. In the same way, you can view the documentation and usage instructions for all OGRePy functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Press Tab to complete the code and write down the full function `welcome()`. Once the code is written, the popup will disappear, but it will reappear again after you write `(` to display the parameters that should go into the parentheses. You can also hover with the mouse over any function to read its documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using JupyterLab instead of VS Code, the popups will not be displayed automatically by default, but you can press <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> to go to the settings, then click on \"Code Completion\" and check \"Show the documentation panel\" and \"Enable autocompletion\". (However, note that the documentation will not be formatted as nicely on JupyterLab.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also view the documentation for a particular OGRePy function using the function `doc()`. For example:"

    "In OGRePy, all tensor objects must have an **associated metric** - except coordinate objects, and the metric tensors themselves. This is because OGRePy automatically raises and lowers indices as appropriate for various operations such as adding and contracting tensors, and it cannot do so without knowing which metric to use. Even scalars, which have no indices, should still be associated to a specific metric - since they can multiply other tensors, and you cannot multiply tensors from different manifolds together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The index configuration of the tensor is a tuple. The number of indices is the rank of the tensor. Each element in the tuple corresponds to one index, with +1 specifying an upper index and -1 specifying a lower index. For example, `(-1, -1)` corresponds to a tensor such as the metric $g_ {\\mu\\nu}$, which has two lower indices, while `(1, -1, -1, -1)` corresponds to a tensor such as the Riemann tensor $R^{\\rho}{}_ {\\sigma\\mu\\nu}$, which has one upper index followed by three lower indices.\n",

    "The components of the tensor can be given in several equivalent forms: a list, a SymPy `Array` object, or (for rank 2 tensors) a SymPy `Matrix` object. Usually, a list is the simplest option if we are specifying the components explicitly. (For advanced users: The components can, more generally, be any SymPy `NDimArray`, including mutable and/or sparse arrays, but OGRePy always stores the components as an immutable dense array, no matter what form the input was originally in.)\n",

    "The components are the representation of the new tensor in the given index configuration and coordinate system. If a coordinate system is not specified, the default coordinate system of the associated metric will be used - but it is recommended to always specify the coordinate system explicitly, to avoid accidentally defining the tensor with the wrong components. The components will be automatically converted to different indices or coordinates later as needed, as we will demonstrate below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a **scalar**, or a tensor of rank 0 (with no indices), we must input an empty tuple `()` for the indices, and a list with exactly one item for the components.

    "As a mnemonic for this formula, recall that two indices may only be contracted if one of them is an upper index and the other is a lower index. If an index is in the denominator of a derivative, then its role is reversed (upper $\\leftrightarrow$ lower). Thus the old (non-primed) and new (primed) indices can only be in places that allow properly contracting the Jacobian or inverse Jacobian with the tensor. For example, $\\alpha_ {1}$ is an upper index in $T$ and therefore must be contracted with a lower index. Thus, $\\partial x^{\\alpha_ {1}}$ must be in the denominator, to lower its index and allow it to be contracted with the tensor.\n",

    "As we saw above, OGRePy automatically knows how to raise or lower indices as needed using the appropriate metric. Similarly, any operation that requires transforming to another coordinate system will preform the transformation automatically behind the scenes. However, for this to happen, OGRePy needs to know the appropriate transformation rules. These are defined between the tensor objects representing the coordinates, which were created as `Coordinates` objects. The rules for transforming from a source coordinate system to a target coordinate system are stored within the tensor object representing the source. This is done using the method `set_coord_transformation()`. To illustrate, let us define transformations from `Cartesian` to `Spherical` and back:"

    "### Customizing the simplification function\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever OGRePy performs an operation that creates or modifies tensor components, such as converting between index representations or coordinate systems, it automatically simplifies the result using SymPy's `simplify()`. However, advanced users may want to have more control over this simplification process. This can be done using by setting `T.options.simplify_func` to a function of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may want to customize the arguments passed to simplify (such as `ratio` or `inverse`, see [here](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/simplify/simplify.html) for more information), or you may want to use specific SymPy simplification functions such as `powsimp()` or `logcombine()` in a specific combination, or even `refine()` with specific assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In extreme situations, you may even want to cancel simplification altogether, if it is taking too long, which can be achieved using `T.options.simplify_func = lambda x: x` - that is, replacing the simplification function with the identity function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual with the `options` object, you may restore the simplification function to the default, SymPy's `simplify()`, with the command `del T.options.simplify_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that changing the simplification function will **not** automatically apply it to any existing tensors. The reason is that when OGRePy calculates the components of a tensor in a particular representation, it calculates them **once and for all**, and then saves them in the object's data to be reused later. This is done to improve performance, so that the components don't have to be recalculated every time they are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can force re-simplification of the stored components of a specific tensor using the method `simplify()`. This will return a new tensor with its components simplified; the original tensor will remain unchanged. However, you can write `MyTensor = MyTensor.simplify()` to store the simplified tensor under the same name.\n",

    "Now that we have all the bookkeeping of tensors out of the way, we can finally discuss how to use those tensors in calculations. In OGRePy, all tensor calculations are performed by simply using normal operations such as addition and multiplications on the tensors. However, this does not work the same as operating, for example, on integers; in most tensor operations, we also have to specify **indices**. Some of these indices will be *free indices**, which will remain in the final result, while others may be **contraction indices**, which will be contracted upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "OGRePy supports a comprehensive collection of tensor operations. A tensor calculation in OGRePy can involve any number of tensor objects and can contain any combination of addition, multiplication by scalar, trace, contraction, partial derivative, and covariant derivative. The result will be stored in a new tensor object. Let us now go over these operations one by one, and give some examples.\n",

    "Addition of tensors in OGRePy is represented by a sum of the form `tensor1(index1, index2, ...) + tensor2(index1, index2, ...)`, where `tensor1` and `tensor2` are the tensor objects to be added, and `(index1, index2, ...)` are the **index specifications** for each tensor, given as SymPy symbols. (Note that an index specification is **not** the same as an index **configuration**, which is a tuple of the form `(Â±1, Â±1, ...)` specifying which indices are up (+1) and which are down (-1).)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you do **not** specify the position (upper or lower) of the indices. Furthermore, just like in any tensor equation, **the index letters themselves have no meaning**; they are just placeholders. Therefore, `(a, b, c)`, `(X, Y, Z)`, and `(alpha, beta, gamma)` are all completely equivalent. The only requirement is that the indices are **consistent**; in the case of addition, this means that both tensors being added must have **the same indices up to permutation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following constraints apply to addition of tensors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may not add a tensor representing a coordinate system to any other tensor, since coordinates do not transform like tensors.\n",

    "### Taking traces and contracting tensors: theoretical review\n",
    "\n",
    "The most complicated tensor operation is **contraction**, a generalization of the vector inner product. This is done by summing over one or more disjoint pairs of indices, with each pair containing exactly one upper index and one lower index. Raising and lowering indices is one example of contraction: the metric (or its inverse) is contracted with a tensor. Coordinate transformations are another example, where we contract the Jacobian (or its inverse) with a tensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest example of contraction is the **vector inner product**, which is defined as the contraction of a vector (one upper index) with a covector (one lower index):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v^{\\mu} w_ {\\mu} = g_ {\\mu\\nu} v^{\\mu} w^{\\nu} = g(\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w}).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The middle part of this equality comes from the fact that, as explained above, when we lower an index on $w^{\\nu}$, we use the metric:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w_ {\\mu} = g_ {\\mu\\nu} w^{\\nu}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This, in turn, justifies the notation $g(\\mathbf{v},\\mathbf{w})$ on the right-hand side, as this is, in fact, an inner product of two vectors using the metric $g$ (in index-free notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Contraction of indices in higher-rank tensors is simply a generalization of the inner product, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^{\\mu\\alpha} B_ {\\alpha\\nu} = g_ {\\alpha\\beta} A^{\\mu\\alpha} B^{\\beta}{}_ {\\nu}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also contract more than one index:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^{\\mu\\nu} B_ {\\mu\\nu} = g_ {\\mu\\alpha} g_ {\\nu\\beta} A^{\\mu\\nu}B^{\\alpha\\beta}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This simply amounts to the fact that lowering both indices of $B^{\\alpha\\beta}$ involves contracting each index with the metric. We can even contract two indices **of the same tensor**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^{\\mu}{}_ {\\mu} = g_ {\\mu\\nu}A^{\\mu\\nu}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **taking the trace**. Furthermore, it is also possible to contract pairs of indices from more than two tensors at the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A^{\\mu\\nu} B_ {\\nu\\rho} C^{\\rho\\sigma} = g_ {\\nu\\alpha} g_ {\\rho\\beta} A^{\\mu\\nu} B^{\\alpha\\beta} C^{\\rho\\sigma}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, such operations can always be broken down into individual contractions of pairs of tensors. For example, in this case, one could first contract $B_ {\\nu\\rho}$ with $C^{\\rho\\sigma}$ and then contract the result with $A^{\\mu\\nu}$ - which is indeed how this kind of contraction will be performed in OGRePy in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    " A^{\\mu\\nu} B_ {\\nu\\rho} C^{\\rho\\sigma} = A^{\\mu\\nu} \\left( B_ {\\nu\\rho} C^{\\rho\\sigma} \\right).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In a contraction, there are two types of indices: **contracted indices**, which are summed upon, and **free indices**, which are not summed upon. The rank of the tensor that results from the contraction is the number of free indices. So for example, in the expression $A^{\\mu\\alpha} B_ {\\alpha\\nu}$ we have one contracted index, $\\alpha$, and two free indices, $\\mu$ and $\\nu$. Therefore, the resulting tensor is of rank two:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T^{\\mu}{}_ {\\nu} = A^{\\mu\\alpha} B_ {\\alpha\\nu}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Taking traces and contracting tensors: OGRePy syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Contraction of tensors in OGRePy is represented by an expression of the form `tensor1(index1, index2, ...) @ tensor2(index1, index2, ...)`, where `tensor1` and `tensor2` are the tensor objects to be contracted, and `(index1, index2, ...)` are the index specifications for each tensor. Any matching indices in both index specifications will be contracted. This means that, for example, $v^{\\mu} w_ {\\mu}$ is calculated using `v(mu) @ w(mu)` and $A^{\\mu\\nu} B_ {\\nu\\rho} C^{\\rho\\sigma}$ is calculated using `A(mu, nu) @ B(nu, rho) @ C(rho, sigma)`. Note that the user doesn't need to worry about the contracted indices being one upper and one lower, which is a common source of errors when contracting tensors by hand; the order of the indices, and whether the same index repeats twice, is all that matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first example, let us create the stress-energy tensor for a perfect fluid with a 4-velocity $u^{\\mu}$. This is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "T^{\\mu\\nu} = (\\rho + p) u^{\\mu} u^{\\nu} + p g^{\\mu\\nu}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though this does not involve any contractions, it still counts as a \"trivial\" contraction, since two tensors (the 4-velocities) are juxtaposed next to each other to create another tensor. This is also known as an **outer product**. Therefore, it uses the same `@` operator syntax as any other contraction, except that there are **no matching indices**. Note that this expression involves not just contraction (in the first term), but also multiplication by scalar (in both terms), and addition of the two terms together. Again, OGRePy takes care of everything behind the scene, so this just works:"

Since OGRePy allows us to easily perform an arbitrary number of contraction, addition, multiplication by scalar, and partial derivative operations, we can calculate the Christoffel symbols of the Schwarzschild metric directly as follows: (We used SymPy's `Rational` class to create a symbolic 1/2 in the front, otherwise it would have been a numeric 0.5)"

If we previously calculated the Christoffel symbols and saved them in a variable called `FLRWChristoffel`, that variable now stores the Christoffel symbols for the **old** FLRW metric, and is therefore inconsistent with the new one.

It is defined as follows:\n",

This is hinted at visually by setting the resulting tensor's symbol to 0, so that you actually see the equations when using `list()`.

In the [Mathematica version of OGRe](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRe), we get a much shorter and nicer expression, but if the two expressions are compared by exporting this expression from SymPy to Mathematica (which can be done using the `mathematica()` method), it turns out that the SymPy expression is in fact correct, just not simplified properly. This appears to be an issue with SymPy's `simplify()` function, but it could perhaps be resolved by using [specific SymPy simplification functions](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/simplify/simplify.html), and it is possible that in the future SymPy's simplification algorithms will improve.)\n",

    "\n",
    "### Bug reports and feature requests\n",
    "\n",
    "This package is under continuous and active development. If you encounter any bugs, or if you would like to request any additional features, please feel free to [open a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRePy/issues) and I will look into it as soon as I can.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contribution and pull request policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions are always welcome. However, I release my projects in cumulative updates after editing and testing them locally on my system, so **my policy is to never accept any pull requests**. If you open a pull request, and I decide to incorporate your suggestion into the project, I will first modify your code to comply with the project's coding conventions (formatting, syntax, naming, comments, programming practices, etc.), and perform some tests to ensure that the change doesn't break anything. I will then merge it into the next release of the project, possibly together with some other changes. The new release will also include a note in `CHANGELOG.md` with a link to your pull request, and modifications to the documentation in `README.md` as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a development environment for this package, download the source code directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRePy), then create a virtual environment in the root folder of the repository [as explained above](#installing-in-a-virtual-environment), activate it, and run `pip install jupyterlab jupytext playwright sympy` to install the development packages, then run `playwright install` to install the browser binaries for HTML to PDF conversion (if desired).\n",
    "\n",
    "For your convenience, a PowerShell script, [update_packages.ps1](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRePy/blob/master/tasks/update_packages.ps1), is provided in the GitHub repository to allow easily updating all outdated packages. A Python script, [compile_docs.py](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRePy/blob/master/tasks/compile_docs.py), is used to compile the documentation in `README.md` to `.ipynb`, `.html`, and `.pdf` formats. Finally, [cleanup.py](https://github.com/bshoshany/OGRePy/blob/master/tasks/cleanup.py) is used to clean up Python and Jupyter cache folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "This package was developed in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). The `.vscode` folder is provided in the GitHub repository for your convenience, including tasks for running the above scripts. It is highly recommended to install the following linters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright): install the Pylance [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance).\n",
    "* [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff): `pip install ruff` and install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=charliermarsh.ruff).\n",
    "* [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/): `pip install pylint` and install the [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.pylint).\n",
